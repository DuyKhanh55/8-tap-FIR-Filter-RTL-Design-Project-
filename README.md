# 8-Tap FIR Filter RTL Design & Verification

An 8-tap low-pass FIR filter implemented in Verilog and verified against a MATLAB golden reference model.

## Highlights

- Designed an 8-tap FIR filter using Verilog RTL.
- Generated Q1.15 coefficients in MATLAB.
- Verified RTL output against a MATLAB reference model.
- Applied a 4-stage pipeline to the MAC datapath, improving Fmax from **33.08 MHz** to **262.12 MHz** (**~7.9× speedup**).
- Synthesized on an Intel Cyclone V FPGA using Quartus Prime.

## How to Run

```bash
vlog fir_filter.v tb_fir_filter.v
vsim tb_fir_filter
run -all
```

Compare `sim_output.txt` against `expected_output.txt`.

Pipeline latency:

- V1: 1 cycle
- V2: 4 cycles

## Tools

- Verilog HDL
- MATLAB
- ModelSim
- Intel Quartus Prime

## Key Learnings

- Identified the combinational MAC as the Fmax-limiting critical path through Quartus timing analysis.
- Traded 3 cycles of latency for a **7.9× increase in maximum operating frequency**, while maintaining throughput.
- Verified functionality against an independent MATLAB golden model rather than relying solely on waveform inspection.
- Applied a common RTL timing-closure technique used in FPGA and ASIC datapath design: **pipelining**.
